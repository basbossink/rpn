### Why could this be helpful

There are a great number of excellent calculator applications available this toy is merely for the simplest of calculations. The only distinguishing feature is that the syntax of the calculator does not use any character that has a special meaning in the shell. This means you can just type the calculation as a set of parameters to the calculator without the need to quote it. The calculator also uses at most the number of significant digits that was used in the input.

### Usage

```sh
$ rpn 2 3 x 
6
$ rpn 2 3 +
